# 🦠 Ebola Outbreak Trends

This project explores the spread and impact of the Ebola virus using official outbreak data from 2014 to 2016. It applies data analysis techniques in Python to uncover patterns in confirmed cases and deaths across affected countries.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Data cleaning and formatting
- Time-series and country-wise analysis
- Grouped insights (by year and country)
- Visualization of deaths and case trends

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Sample Insights

- In 2015, **Liberia** recorded ~2.2 million cases and ~999,000 deaths.
- **Sierra Leone** and **Guinea** also experienced massive outbreaks.
- **Minimal cases** occurred in Italy, Spain, and the U.S., indicating some global spread.

## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis reveals that the Ebola outbreak had its most devastating impact in West Africa, particularly during 2014–2015. The virus was largely contained by 2016. Early detection and responsive healthcare infrastructure were vital in limiting global spread. The dataset also reflects the importance of consistent and timely data reporting during epidemics.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Strengthen Health Systems:** Focus on healthcare infrastructure in vulnerable countries to improve outbreak response.
- **Improve Data Collection:** Timely, complete, and standardized data is essential during health crises.
- **Public Awareness:** Governments should invest in health education to prevent the spread of future epidemics.
- **Global Cooperation:** Shared data and collaborative response across nations can prevent escalation.
